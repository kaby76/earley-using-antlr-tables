# earley-using-antlr-tables

This repo contains two implementations of [Earley parsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earley_parser).

The first example, [csharp](https://github.com/kaby76/earley-using-antlr-tables/tree/main/csharp),
is a straightforward implementation of the algorithm pseudo-code at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earley_parser#Pseudocode.
This implementation contains the methods `Predictor()`, `Scanner()`, and `Completor()`, and they are called in code that mirrors the pseudo-code.

The second example, [antlr](https://github.com/kaby76/earley-using-antlr-tables/tree/main/antlr), is a proof-of-concept
implementation of Earley using the Antlr4 parser [ATNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_transition_network).
There is an equivalence between a grammar and a collection of the Antlr4 ATNs. It makes little sense to
start with an Antlr4 grammar and not utilize the ATN representation. The main issue with this approach is that some Antlr4 grammars
are not `ALL(*)`, but are context-free. For example, mutual left-recursion is not supported by Antlr4, but you could write such a grammar in Antlr syntax.
