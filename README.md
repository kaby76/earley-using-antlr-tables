# earley-using-antlr-tables

This repo contains two implementations of [Earley parsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earley_parser).

The first example, [csharp](https://github.com/kaby76/earley-using-antlr-tables/tree/main/csharp),
is a straight-forward implementation of the algorithm pseudo-code at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earley_parser#Pseudocode.
This implementation contains the methods Predictor(), Scanner(), and Completor(), and are
called in code that mirrors exactly the pseudo-code.

The second example, [antlr](https://github.com/kaby76/earley-using-antlr-tables/tree/main/antlr), is a proof-of-concept
Implementation of Earley using the Antlr4 parser [ATNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_transition_network).
There is an equivalence between a grammar and a collection of the Antlr4 ATNs.
